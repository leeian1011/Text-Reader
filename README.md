# Simple Text-Reader in Rust

Currently transitioning from C to Rust, took some time to read the book and learn the massive differences between C and Rust.
Having just surface level understanding of OOP and no background in FP, I hope I'll be able to catch up to speed in the paradigms
although I believe I will probably have a much different view on the paradigms as I am learning them through Rust even though Rust does not
entirely practice either paradigms.

## Objectives in this Project

Hope to maybe learn more about how the ownership/borrowing memory system works by messing around with the `Strings` and `&str` types.
I also just learn better by building random stuff so hopefully this works out :p
